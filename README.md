    ℹ️ Information ℹ️
  </h3>
  <br>
  <span> A banking application, which converts all values to the BRL exchange rate, facilitating unnecessary bills, and with a great control over your expenses. Use the descriptions, tags, and others to organize yourself even more. </span> 
  <br><br>
  <span> Here we get around the problem of prop drilling in past projects in React using Redux, the framework used to pass and use global states in a more practical and scalable way. </span>
